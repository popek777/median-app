# median-app

to build and execute:
./build_tests_and_app.sh && ./run_tests_and_app.sh

complexity:
- find position to insert in vector: O(ln2)
- insert into vector: O(n), 

I choose the logarithmic 'pos find' even if I insert into vector in linear time to
save linear int comparisions (small preoptimization :))
